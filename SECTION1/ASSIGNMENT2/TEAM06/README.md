#### A little more about Nishanth Shetty  : 
I am a senior at the University of California, Los Angeles pursuing a major in Statistics. I am passionate about capital markets and getting to know companies both operationally and financially and have accumulated prior internship experience in Healthcare and Financial Services. I kicked off my professional experience as a Finance & Operations Intern at Soukare, a medical e-commerce company in Dubai, before going on to be a Medical Product Management Intern at Gyant, a medical AI startup in San Francisco. In my most recent position, I worked as a Summer Analyst at Deloitte Corporate Finance.
